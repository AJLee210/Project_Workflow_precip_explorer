# precip_explorer
This is the repository for the ESS580A9 class. I have no specific project for mine as a PSM student, so I will use the live-cord of the class for developing skills. The below is a description about this repository. 


1. Using riem to explore precipitation data in Colorado.

2. Whole data would store in the 'Data' folder, but 'raw' and 'cleaned' data will be seperately stocked in sub-folder of the Data folder.

3. Final results would put in the folder named 'Output', but if I use 'booddown' later, the output might be moved to the new folder named 'docs'.
